What is the final title of your project?
	Archi x Inspo

What is the problem statement of your project?
	Our goal is to create a gallery of models and concepts for inspiration. This would make projects easier for architecture majors or anyone who is inclined to tasks such as model making or computer-assisted design (CAD). It would serve a purpose similar to Pinterest for artists in the sense where one would look up concepts to take inspiration from. 

Who are the potential stakeholders of your project?
	Architecture students and enthusiasts would have the advantage of looking into this website. Aside from the clients above, teachers and critics alike can grade or evaluate projects that have been submitted in the event they want to use a project as a demonstration for their future classes.

What is this projectâ€™s scope?
	This website will have a homepage for everyone's project. The website will be geared towards a modest and open mindset. There will be a subpage for tips and tricks as well as tutorials. Another page could lead to a storefront for a Blick or art store where we can find the supplies necessary for a project.
